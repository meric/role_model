This is a simple module is designed to record historical changes of models.

Test:
  `python manage.py test history.tests`

Potential for improvements:
  1. Consider using database triggers to more fully capture changes.
  2. For a more sophisticated framework, see [Django Reversion](https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion).
  3. Refactor the History.delta into separate fields?

# Future #

Write more tests.
