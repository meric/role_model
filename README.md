# About #

This is a demonstrative project of a good way to write Django code.

Up to commit cc04403, this project took 3 working days to write.

At the moment this is a project to store a company's list of responsibilities
it's employees performed and the responsibilities assigned to each role.

It's meant to be a DESCRIPTIVE tool, not a prescriptive one.
